# HaplowebMaker
HaplowebMaker is a web tool that creates automatically haplowebs (Flot et al. 2010) from one or several FASTA files.

# Installation

Just copy / paste this folder into a webserver.

If you want to use HaplowebMaker offline, either install a local webserver (recommended) or activate CORS requests so that the HaplowebMaker website can load it's resources in the corresponding subdirectories
(This is not recommended as this has some security implications).

In order to activate CORS requests in Firefox, enter about:config as URL, accept the warning message and set the setting "privacy.file_unique_origin" to false.

# Usage

Open http(s)://&lt;name of your webbrowser&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/index.html in any modern browser that fully supports HTML 5.
